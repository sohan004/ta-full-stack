# Real-Time Collaborative Notes App

## ‚úÖ Objective
Build a Real-Time Collaborative Notes Application where multiple users can create, edit, and view notes in real-time with JWT-based authentication and Socket.IO for live updates, using Next.js 14, Redux Toolkit, Socket.IO, Express.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design.

| Technology         | Purpose                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Next.js 14          | Fullstack framework |
| Redux Toolkit    | State management |
| Socket.IO         | Real-time communication |

## üõë Core Features

### JWT-based Authentication
- Signup/Login with Access & Refresh Tokens.
- Secure refresh token in HTTP-only cookie.
- Access token stored in memory for security.

### Real-Time Collaboration (Socket.IO)
- Live editing of notes.
- Real-time updates without page refresh.
- Multi-user collaboration on the same note.

### Backend API (Express.js + MongoDB)
- User Authentication (Signup, Login, Logout, Token Refresh).
- CRUD operations for notes (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- WebSocket connection for real-time note updates.

### Frontend UI (Next.js + Redux Toolkit + Ant Design + Tailwind CSS)
- Authentication screens (Signup, Login, Logout).
- Dashboard for creating and editing notes.
- Real-time collaborative editing experience.

### Bonus Features
- User presence tracking (show who is editing).
- Optimized SEO with Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

## üìÇ Architecture Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ User logs in ‚Üí Access token issued ‚Üí Stored in memory.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time WebSocket connection established.

3Ô∏è‚É£ User edits a note ‚Üí Sends update to server via Socket.IO.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Server broadcasts updated note to all connected users.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Redux state updates and UI reflects changes in real-time.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Access token expires ‚Üí Automatically refresh using Refresh Token.

## üéØ Final Output
